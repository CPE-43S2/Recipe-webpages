        <h1>KINILAW NA TAMILOK</h>
            <br>
            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>Tamilok is a unique Filipino delicacy that many people mistakenly call a "woodworm," but it's actually a marine mollusk - specifically a shipworm (Teredo navalis). This mollusk is a type of saltwater clam that burrows into submerged wooden structures like mangrove trees, which is why it gets the woodworm nickname.</p>
            <p>In terms of culinary use, tamilok is most commonly prepared as "kinilaw" - a Filipino ceviche-style dish where it's marinated in vinegar and citrus juices (usually calamansi), which effectively "cooks" the mollusk through acid. When prepared properly, tamilok has a soft, creamy texture similar to oysters with a mild, slightly sweet flavor profile.</p>
