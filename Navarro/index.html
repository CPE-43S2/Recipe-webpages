        <p><strong>Milk</strong> - I prefer using whole milk for my lattes because the higher fat content results in a creamier, dreamier mouthfeel. That said, feel free to swap in the dairy or (unsweetened) plant-based milk of your choice.</p>
        <p><strong>Sweetened Condensed Milk</strong> - This thick, syrupy canned dairy product is a staple in plenty of dessert recipes (I use it in my kiwi lime pie and this stellar Vietnamese coffee cake), but it’s also the ultimate latte sweetener! Just make sure you don’t confuse it with evaporated milk, which comes in a similar looking can but tastes vastly different. </p>
        <p><strong>Espresso</strong> - An authentic Spanish latte is specifically made with espresso shots brewed from arabica coffee beans, but feel free to use what you have! I do recommend a medium or dark roast to make sure that rich coffee flavor gets its chance to shine. If needed, you can also substitute with strongly-brewed coffee or - if you don’t have a coffee machine - cold brew. </p>
        <p><strong>Ice Cubes</strong> - If possible, opt for ice made with filtered water for the best taste. If you’re worried about flavor/caffeine dilution, swap in coffee ice cubes instead!</p>
